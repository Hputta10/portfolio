- project: Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention
  role: Data Analysis, Machine Learning | Stevens Institute Technology  
  duration: Jan. 2023 &mdash; Mar. 2023
  url: "https://github.com/REDZ777/Predicted-purchase-intent-of-e-commerce-website-visitors-"
  description: <ul>
                <li>Predicted purchase intent of e-commerce website visitors using supervised learning algorithms in python</li>
                <li>Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor, Multilayer Perceptron, and Adaptive Boosting. Found Random Forest was most effective classifier with accuracy of 77%</li>
                <li>Incorporated SMOTE technique to improve classifier performance and Scalability of each classifier, Random Forest classifier performed best with accuracy of 91%</li>
               </ul>
# Predicting Financial Distress 
- project: Predicting Financial Distress 
  role: Data Analysis, Machine Learning | Stevens Institute Technology  
  duration: oct. 2022 &mdash; Dec. 2022

  description: <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a credit scoring algorithm that uses machine learning to predict an applicant's likelihood of default, increasing efficiency and accuracy of loan decisions</li>
                <li>Leveraged Python pandas library to extract and parse data, matplotlib library to conduct exploratory data analysis and create compelling visualizations and SKlearn machine learning libraries to develop predictive models</li>
                  <li>Uncovered issue of data set imbalance, leading to 93% of customers not facing financial distress; rectified problem by applying SMOTE technique to balance data set</li>
                <li>Diagnosed classification problem at hand and deployed Random Forest Classifier achieved accuracy of 95%</li>
